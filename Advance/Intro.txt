Difference between var let const 

var was available in old JS  i.e ES5

var variables have function scope meaning var variables can be used anywhere in its parent function/ global 

Ex:

function abcd(){
    for(var i = 0 ; i<12 ; i++){
        console.log(i);
    }
    console.log(i);
}

here i is available even after the loop because its declared using var keyword i.e
due to Function scope of var keyword 

To Fix this we can use let , Let has Braces Scope or Block scope i.e 
Its available only in the block { } in which its defined. 

let and const keywords came into picture only in New version of JS i.e
ES6

let has braces scope or Block scope {}


Browser Context API 
-Provides windows object , Stack , heap of browser for JS to use in 


Execution Context means when a function is called it creates an imaginary 
container which includes 3 things in it :
1) variables
2) Functions inside that parent function
3)lexical environment of that function

This imaginary container is called the Execution Context 


Execution Context is a container where the Functions code is executed and
its created whenever a function is called , it contains 3 things , variables,
Functions and lexical environment of that function.

Ex: function abcd(){
        var a = 12; 
        function def(){
            var b = 12;
        }
}

Lexical environment is a chart which includes the details of that particular function 
regarding what all things that Function can access and which it cannot access
Means It holds Scope and Scope chain
